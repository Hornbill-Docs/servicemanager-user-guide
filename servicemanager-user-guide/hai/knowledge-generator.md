# Knowledge Generator
Create a new knowledge article instantly from a prompt. Save time creating and looking for knowledge.

### Benefits to you
* Eliminate time spent looking for how-to knowledge.
* Save time/effort/cost creating knowledge articles for your knowledge base.
* Improve quality and effectiveness of knowledge - meaning more efficient *use* of knowledge.
* Speed up the incident resolution and request response.
* Empower end users with more self-fixes to deflect calls from your service desk.
* Increase agent case throughput. Reduce backlogs. Cut workloads and stress. Reduce staff churn.

### What you can do
* Quickly create and share new knowledge articles to help agents and end users solve common, generic issues.
* Shorten and listify existing knowledge articles at the click of a button.
* Create/adapt content for different audiences (e.g. technical and non-technical) with automatic tone adjustment.
* Knowledge Generator outputs content in HTML.
* A new knowledge article can also be created from a resolved request record and submitted as a draft item to be curated.

Note: The HAi Knowledge Generator *does not* take input from your own Hornbill Knowledge Base. Responses are powered by OpenAI.

### Where to find it
Look for the HAi icon in the Knowledge Base Article screen top right corner of the main knowledge article content box.

### How to use it
Create new knowledge articles in 2 simple steps:
## (1)
Input and highlight the text you want to use as a prompt. Click "Knowledge Generation" in the drop-down menu. Either start from scratch with a prompt (e.g. "Write a guide on changing the printer ink in Epson printers") or use a prompt to add content to an existing knowledge article (E.g. "Add a paragraph explaining how to do this using terminal access rather than the GUI"). Your highlighted text will be replaced by the Knowledge Generator output. If no prompt is highlighted, the whole content of the text field will be used as the prompt - and the output will be appended to the *end* of the existing text.

## (2)
OpenAI generates the content. Click the tick to add it to your knowledge article â€“ where you can edit the content or use the HAi options to change the tone, shorten, or listify.

### Tips and Tricks
1. Highlighting text to use as a prompt - If you already have a knowledge document that needs some additional material you can ask using the Ask HAi instruction with the prompt highlighted and the rest of the knowledge document will be sent as additional context to the generated response makes sense and is formatted accordingly, once generated the response will overwrite the highlighted text instead of being appended to the end.
