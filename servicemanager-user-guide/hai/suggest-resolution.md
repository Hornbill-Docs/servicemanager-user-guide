# Suggest Resolution
Automatically generate user-friendly request resolutions from technical updates from team members.

### Benefits to you
* Agent assistance: Save time producing user-friendly resolution content that can be presented to the customer.
* Agent deflection: Reduce inbound calls. Reduce tickets/backlog. Reduce stress. Cut staff churn.
* User experience: Empower users to do more, faster. No waiting. Customers get back to being productive faster.

### What you can do
* Simplify very technical request resolutions into content that's suitable for end-user consumption.
* Generate request resolutions from a post in a ticket timeline (top level; not comments to posts). 
* Or simply paste a block of text into the Request Resolution box and click *Suggest Resolution* to generate user-friendly content.

### Where to find it
In any request record. Accessible as a drop-down menu option in the Request Resolution field and any timeline posts.
