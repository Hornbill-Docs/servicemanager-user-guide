# Wiki Markup
For easy formatting of text in Hornbill, a subset of wiki markup can be used for decorating text with italics or bold, creating bulleted or numbered lists, and defining titles and subtitles. Wiki markup lets you quickly apply some basic formatting to your text as you type, giving it that extra touch to make it stand out.

## Section Headings
Using the equal sign (=) on either side of a word creates a section heading. The number of equal signs determines the size of the heading. Each heading is followed by a line break.


```md
=Heading 1=
==Heading 2==
===Heading 3===
```
