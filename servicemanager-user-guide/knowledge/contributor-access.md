# Contributor Access
Contributor Access lets you control who can create and edit articles within the knowledge base. If there are no entries in Contributor Access, then all users with the Knowledge Contributor role can access the selected knowledge base.

To get to Contributor Access, first navigate to a knowledge base, then in the navigation pane, click the key icon.

To limit who can create and edit articles in a knowledge base, select an access type (either User or Team) and then make a selection based on that access type.
