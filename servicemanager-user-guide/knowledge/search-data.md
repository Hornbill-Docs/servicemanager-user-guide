# Search Data
The Knowledge search data helps analyze what people are searching for.  This can help provide insight into how to organize your knowledge and identify gaps.

* **Date.** The date/time that the search was run.
* **Search Term.** The full search that was entered by the user.
* **Results.** The number of articles that were returned in the search results.
* **Source.** Where the search was initiated from.
* **Searched By.** The user that performed the search.
* **User Type.** Identifies whether the person performing the search is a basic user, full user, or contact.

A valuable aspect of search data is identifying instances of someone having searched for something without getting any results. Getting no results --- or in some cases, too many results --- can impact the usefulness of your Knowledge content. Using this data can continually help you improve your Knowledge content. Ask yourself:
* Are there any articles covering what they are looking for?
* Do existing articles contain the correct text for the articles?
* Where are most of the searches coming from?
* Is a search term trending on a particular day?

Use the filter to show searches that contain a particular word.
* How many times has this word been included in a search?
