A valuable aspect of search data is identifying when someone has searched for something, but they are not getting any results.  Getting no results or in some cases, too many results can impact the usefulness of your knowledge. Using this data can continually help you improve your knowledge content.
* Are there any articles covering what they are looking for?
* Do existing articles contain the correct text for the articles?
* Where are most of the searches coming from?
* Is a search term trending on a particular day?

Use the filter to show searches that contain a particular word.
