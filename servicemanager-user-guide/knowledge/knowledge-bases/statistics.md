# Statistics
Knowledge base statistics let you identify trends within a single knowledge base.  These trends can help identify missing content or poorly written articles.

## Available charts

The following four charts are available to provide an analysis of your knowledge data.  Use the Next and Previous arrows at the bottom to scroll through the charts.

### Article Views
Each time an article is opened via browse or search is considered one view.  Articles that are opened by knowledge contributors in Edit mode are not included in this count.
