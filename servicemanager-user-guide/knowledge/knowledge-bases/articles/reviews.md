# Reviews
Reviews provide a way for knowledge base managers and contributors to schedule activities on each article. These can be used as simple reminders to visit an article to check if it is still valid, if any updates are needed, or to check the [statistics and feedback](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/knowledge-bases/articles/statistics) on the article to understand how effective the article has been.

## Viewing reviews
Once a review has been added to an article, it is added to the Review List for that article.  You will likely want to also view this alongside your other activities. The review activities can also be seen in the My Activities pop-out panel and the My Activities view.

### My Activities pop-out panel
The My Activities pop-out panel is accessed from the right-hand vertical bar, which is available no matter where you are in Hornbill.

The My Activities view is a central location for all your activities.  This includes your Knowledge reviews.

**To access My Activities:**

2. From the Home menu, select **My Activities**.
