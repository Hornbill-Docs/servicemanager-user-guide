# Moving FAQs into knowledge bases

To convert a FAQ to a knowledge article, you first need to have access to the relevant service with the Services Manager role. Once you have access to the service, then you will need the Knowledge Contributor role to create the new article.

The conversion is a copy rather than a move. After you convert the content of a FAQ to a knowledge article, the original FAQ remains with the service.

**To convert an existing FAQ to a knowledge base article:**
1. In the left-hand menu bar, navigate to Service Management > Service Portfolio.
1. In the Service Portfolio tab, find the service to which your existing FAQ applies, and click its name.
1. In the top menu bar, click the **FAQs** button (the question mark icon).
1. In the list of FAQs, click the name of the question you want to make into an article.
1. In the Update FAQ dialog, scroll to the bottom and click **Knowledge > Convert to Article**.
1. You are now taken to Knowledge, landing in the Configuration for a new knowledge base article. Make selections and entries to configure the article, then click **Create**.
