# Approvals
Each knowledge base has a setting to enable approvals.  When this is turned on, any contributor will have to submit a new article for approval before it can be published and visible to readers.

When approvals are turned on, the knowledge base owner will be excluded from the approval process.  Articles they create will be able to be published without needed approval.

## Draft Articles
When a contributor creates a new article, the status will be set as `Draft`.  The contributor will be able to edit and update their article.  When the article is complete the contributor can submit the article for approval. This will trigger a notification to the knowledge base owner.

## Approval Pending
As a knowledge owner, they have an option of either accepting or rejecting the article.
* **Reject**.  This will reset the article to draft and notify the article owner about the rejection.  The article owner will have an opportunity to make edits and resubmit when it is ready.
* **Accept**. This will allow the article to proceed and the status will be set to `Published`.
* **Cancel Approval**. The article creator may have submitted an article for approval, but they have found mistakes or additional information that needs to be added. The creator can cancel the approval to bring the article back to draft so that changes can be made and then resubmitted.

## Published
Approvals are only applicable to new articles. Once an article has been published, edits and updates can be tracked in the audit log.
