# Approvals
Each knowledge base has a setting to enable approvals.  When this is turned on, any contributor will have to submit a new article for approval before it can be published and visible to readers.

When approvals are turned on, the articles that are created by the knowledge base owner are excluded from the approval process.

## Draft Articles
When a contributor creates a new article, the status is set to `Draft`.  The contributor can edit and update the article.  When the article is complete, the contributor can submit the article for approval. This triggers a notification to the knowledge base owner.

## Approval Pending
The knowledge base owner has the option of either accepting or rejecting the article.
* **Reject.**  This resets the article to draft and notifies the article owner about the rejection.  The article owner can then make edits and resubmit.
* **Accept.** This allows the article to proceed and the status will be set to `Published`.
* **Cancel Approval.** This resets the article to draft. This is useful if the article owner needs to make updates to the article after having submitted it for approval. The article owner can then make edits and resubmit.

## Published
Approvals are only applicable to new articles. Once an article has been published, edits and updates can be tracked in the audit log.
