## Adding a related article

From the list of related articles, there is a `+` button for adding a new related article.  This opens a search to locate the article that needs to be linked.

* The results of this search will only display other articles that have been published.
* The selected article might not be visible to a user if the article has been set to not be visible from within the portal that they are using.
* Related articles are one-way.  Relating one article to another does not automatically apply a relationship in the other direction.
