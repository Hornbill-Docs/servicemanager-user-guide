# Subscriptions
Users with the Knowledge Base Manager role can control knowledge base access through service subscriptions. For example, a service called Desktop Support can be given a subscription to a knowledge base called Hardware Troubleshooting. All end users who have the Desktop Support service will then have visibility of the Troubleshooting knowledge base.

You create subscriptions in the Subscriptions view of a knowledge base. You can view subscriptions both by knowledge base, and by service (in Service Portfolio).
