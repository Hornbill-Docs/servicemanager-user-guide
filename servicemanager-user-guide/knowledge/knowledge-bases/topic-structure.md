# Topic Structure
Topics are a type of categorization for knowledge base articles.  A heirarchical structure can be created using topics in order to provide a logical grouping of articles and a way to easily navigate through to the knowledge that they are looking for.

## Before You Begin
* To create and mange topics, either the Knowledge Administrator role or the Knowledge Manager role is required.

## How To Access
Topics and topic structures are unique to each knowledge base.  Before you begin adding topics, you must first create a knowledge base.  Once created, the Topic Structure option can be found in the navigation panel for that knowledge base.
