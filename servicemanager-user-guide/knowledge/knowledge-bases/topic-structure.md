# Topic Structure
Topics are a type of categorization for knowledge base articles. You can create a hierarchical structure using topics to provide a logical grouping of articles and a way to easily navigate through to the knowledge that users are looking for.

## Before you begin
* To create and manage topics, you must have either the Knowledge Administrator role or the Knowledge Manager role assigned to you.
* To organize articles into a structure, you must first have created articles in your knowledge base. The articles don't need to be complete, but they need to have article IDs and titles.

## Accessing the Topic Structure view
Topics and topic structures are unique to each knowledge base. Once you have created a knowledge base, you can find the Topic Structure option in the navigation panel for that knowledge base.

1. Click the **+** button.
