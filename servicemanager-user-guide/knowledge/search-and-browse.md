# Search / Browse
This view is shared by all users as a place where they can find and read the knowledge that is available to them.  From here users can browse through the knowledge bases using the topic trees or they can use the search to find specific articles.

Another way to browse by knowledge base is once you have found an article via search. When you open the article from the results list, you are taken to the full-browse feature with the article you searched for opened.
