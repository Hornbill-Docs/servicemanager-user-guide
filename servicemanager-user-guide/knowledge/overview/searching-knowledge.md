# How Knowledge content is accessed
Once an end user has been granted to access to Knowledge, that user can find articles in several ways: 
* global search
* through Search on the portals
* in the Knowledge Base Articles widget that can be added to the portals
in the Services widget against the articles' associated service

Knowledge articles also can be surfaced when service desk agents raise requests. The agent can begin typing in the Summary field of a new incident and then immediately see relevant articles. The agent can then use the articles to support the customer directly, or share them with the customer.
