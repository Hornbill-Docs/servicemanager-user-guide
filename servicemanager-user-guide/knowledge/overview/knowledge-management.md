# Why knowledge management matters
**Shared, accessible information.** When information is not easily accessible within an organization, it can be time-consuming and costly for staff to have to rediscover how something was configured, how a previous issue was resolved, or how something works. Having an organization's shared knowledge stored and readily accessible frees staff to work on meaningful tasks.

**Expertise captured.** A well-implemented knowledge system allows all the experts in an organization to easily contribute. Capturing and sharing information is key to the efficiency of those who are on both sides of the service desk.
