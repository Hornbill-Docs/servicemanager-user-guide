# About the Knowledge structure
At the top level of Knowledge is the knowledge base. Inside the knowledge base are *topics*, which you can think of as folders and sub-folders that contain articles.
* **Knowledge bases.** You may want to build out only one knowledge base, or you may want several. There is no limit to how many knowledge bases your organization can have.
* **Topics.** You can use [topics](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/knowledge-bases/topic-structure) to provide a hierarchical structure that is unique to each knowledge base. Topics are not required, but when you do choose to use them, they provide an easy-to-navigate tree that contains knowledge articles. Topics can be moved around in the structure of a knowledge base, and they can go up to five levels deep.
* **Articles.** Individual [articles](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/knowledge-bases/articles/configuration) that contain your knowledge content.
