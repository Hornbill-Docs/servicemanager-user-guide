# Welcome to Hornbill Knowledge
Knowledge within Service Manager is an invaluable resource for organizing, storing, and sharing your organization's information. With Knowledge, your organization's collective expertise can be developed collaboratively and easily shared --- internally and externally. Use Knowledge to gather your staff's insights, know-how, and resolutions all in one place for everyone's use.

**Self-service.** Built for agent deflection and self-service, Knowledge is fully integrated into the self-service experience, as well as the Intelligent Capture logging experience for analysts. Everything your organization puts into your knowledge bases can be searched across the entire Hornbill platform using global search, with customizable gating in place to ensure Knowledge consumers see only the content meant for them. For more details on how end users can view the content of your knowledge bases, see [Search/Browse](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/search-and-browse).

**Subscriptions.** Hornbill Service Manager provides a join between knowledge bases and services; you can set up [a subscription model](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/knowledge-bases/subscriptions) to meet your organization's specific needs based on the Knowledge content you have and the services you offer. When you first create a knowledge base, by default it's open to all. To restrict access, you add knowledge-base subscriptions to individual services. Users who can see an individual service can then see the knowledge bases that service subscribes to.

**Access.** [Roles](/servicemanager-config/setup/service-manager-roles#knowledge-roles) determine who can do what to knowledge bases. Those with the Knowledge Manager role can further customize who can create content by controlling [*contributor access*](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/knowledge-bases/contributor-access). Knowledge Base Managers can grant access for content creation to named teams or users. This access is independent of service subscriptions; for example, you could add the Finance department to your knowledge base to allow the staff of that department to contribute content and edits.

**Approvals.** Hornbill Knowledge provides publishing and auditing processes for [ensuring quality and review stages](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/knowledge-bases/activity-and-audit).

**Analytics.** Hornbill Knowledge captures metrics such as article views and likes that you can view in [customizable charts](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/dashboard), along with [search data](/servicemanager-user-guide/knowledge/search-data). By tracking usage and effectiveness, you can identify gaps and continually improve content and accessibility.
