# Overview
Knowledge within Service Manager is a key component to organizing, storing, and sharing information within an organization. It has the possibility of becoming an invaluable resource for collecting insights, know-how, and your staff's expertise all in one place that can all be used for improving operational efficiency and providing assistance to everyone.

## Why Does Knowledge Matter?
* When information is not easily accessible within an organization, it can be time consuming and costly when having to re-discover how something was configured, how a previous issue was resolved, and how something works.  Having this stored knowledge gives more time for staff to work on meaningful tasks.
* When a knowledge system is well implemented, it allows for easy contribution by the experts in your organization. Capturing and sharing information can be key to the efficiency of those who are on both sides of the service desk.
