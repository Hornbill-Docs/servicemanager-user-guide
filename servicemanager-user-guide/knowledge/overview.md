# Overview
Knowledge within Service Manager is an invaluable resource for organizing, storing, and sharing your organization's information. With Knowledge, your organization's collective expertise can be developed collaboratively and shared internally and externally. You can use Knowledge to gather your staff's insights, know-how, and resolutions all in one place for everyone's use.  --- and see the immediate benefits of improved operational efficiency and providing assistance to everyone.

Hornbill Knowledge was built for agent deflection and self-service. Knowledge is fully integrated into the self-service experience, as well as the Intelligent Capture logging experience for analysts. Everything your organization puts into your knowledge bases can be searched across the entire Hornbill platform using Global Search, with customizable gating in place to ensure Knowledge consumers see only the content meant for them. For more details on how end users can view the content of your knowledge bases, see [Search/Browse](/search-and-browse).

Service-based entitlement gating customer access to appropriate content. CAN WE SAY SOMETHING HERE ABOUT HOW KNOWLEDGE RELATES TO SERVICES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS TO EXPLAIN A BIT ABOUT HOW KNOWLEDGE CONTENT IS CONSUMED BY END USERS?

There is a specialist Knowledge Base Articles widget that you can deploy. This widget only shows the content the end user is allowed to see.

Against the individual service, we have knowledge that is part of KBs that are a part of the service. We have made the join between services and KBs; that is, your subscription model. When creating a knowledge base, by default it's open to all. To restrict access, you add Knowledge subscriptions to individual services. If a user can see the individual service, then they can see the knowledge bases that service subscribes to.

Analytics for monitoring knowledge use and improving content and accessibility

## Why does knowledge matter?
* When information is not easily accessible within an organization, it can be time-consuming and costly when staff have to rediscover how something was configured, how a previous issue was resolved, or how something works. Having an organization's shared knowledge stored and readily accessible gives more time for staff to work on meaningful tasks.
* When a knowledge system is well-implemented, all the experts in an organization can easily contribute. Capturing and sharing information can be key to the efficiency of those who are on both sides of the service desk.
* By enabling efficient access to relevant information, reducing redundant efforts, and promoting self-service, Hornbill Knowledge can drive significant operational efficiencies for your organization. Use Knowledge to streamline incident resolution, improve service quality, and reduce costs, all while enhancing the overall productivity of both your staff and your service end-users.

## Before you begin
* Review the available [knowledge roles](/servicemanager-config/setup/service-manager-roles#knowledge-roles) that can be assigned to the different types of users.
* Consider the types of articles that you will want to use for your knowledge bases.

## About the Knowledge structure
At the top level of Knowledge is the knowledge base. Inside the knowledge base are *topics*, which you can think of as folders that contain articles.
* **Knowledge bases.** You may want to build out only one knowledge base, or you may want several. There is no limit to how many knowledge bases your organization can have.
* **Topics.** You can use topics to provide a hierarchical structure that is unique to each knowledge base. Topics are not required, but when you do choose to use them, they provide an easy-to-navigate tree that contains Knowledge articles. Topics can be moved around in the structure of a knowledge base, and they can go up to five levels deep.
* **Articles.** Individual articles that contain your Knowledge content.

## Gathering Knowledge
* Article creation based on research.
* Reusable content based from the resolution of incidents.
* Capturing intellectual knowledge from staff.
* Using HAi for automatic creation of articles.

## Sharing Knowledge
* Suggesting knowledge to end users during the raising of a request.
* Assigning support staff to help find solutions.
* Portal widgets to promote popular articles.
* Browsing knowledge bases and their topics.

Roles determine who can do what to KBs. Those with the Knowledge Manager role can further customize who can create content by controlling *contributor access*. Knowledge Managers can grant access for content creation to named teams or users. This access is independent of service subscriptions, for example, you could add the Finance department to your KB to allow them to contribute articles and edits.
