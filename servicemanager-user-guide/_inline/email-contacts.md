## Email Contacts
Email Contacts are recipients that can be associated with individual Service Manager requests. They are designed to improve speed and consistency when sending emails from a request by ensuring that relevant recipients are automatically included in communications.

Email Contacts reduce the need for analysts to manually add the same recipients each time an email is sent from a request.
