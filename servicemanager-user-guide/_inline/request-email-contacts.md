# Email Contacts
The [Email Contacts](https://docs.hornbill.com/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/request-email-contacts) feature is like an email address book for the request. This is designed to improve the speed and consistency when sending emails from a request by ensuring that the relevant contacts are included.

## How Email Contacts work
When sending an email from a request, either using the [Email Action](https://docs.hornbill.com/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/email-action) or when replying to an email in the request's timeline, the `To`, `Cc`, and `Bcc` fields are automatically populated with the email contacts. Individual contacts can be excluded from emails by clicking on the envelope icon next to their name.

## Adding contacts
When a request is raised from an email, if there are additional recipients in the `To` or `Cc` fields, they are automatically added to the Email Contacts list.

Contacts can be added manually using the `+` button if the request was not raised from an email or if there are additional contacts to add after the request has been raised.

See the full [Email Contacts documentation](https://docs.hornbill.com/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/request-email-contacts) for more information.
