# Email Contacts
The [Email Contacts](https://docs.hornbill.com//servicemanager-user-guide/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/request-email-contacts) feature is like an email address book for the request. This is designed to improve speed and consistency when sending emails from a request by ensuring that the relevant contacts are included.

## How Email Contacts work
When a request is either manually or automatically raised from an email, if there are additional recipients in the To or Cc fields, they are saved to the [Email Contacts](https://docs.hornbill.com//servicemanager-user-guide/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/request-email-contacts) list. These contacts can then be used in future email communications when using the [Email Action](/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/email-action) or when replying to an email in the request's timeline.  The contacts in the list will be automatically added to the To, Cc, or Bcc fields of these outgoing emails.
