## Email Contacts
[Email Contacts](https://docs.hornbill.com//servicemanager-user-guide/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/request-email-contacts) are recipients that can be associated with individual requests. They are designed to improve speed and consistency when sending emails from a request by ensuring that relevant recipients are included in communications.
