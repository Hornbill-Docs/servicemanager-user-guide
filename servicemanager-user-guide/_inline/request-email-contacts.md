# Email Contacts

The [Email Contacts](https://docs.hornbill.com/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/request-email-contacts) feature is like an email address book for the request. This feature helps you communicate quickly and ensures you include the right people in your messages every time.

## How Email Contacts work

When you use the [Email action](https://docs.hornbill.com/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/requests/email-action) on a request, the system automatically fills the **To**, **Cc**, and **Bcc** fields with your saved contacts.

* **Reply to contacts**: When you reply to an email from the request timeline, select **Reply to Contacts** to include all associated recipients.
* **Exclude recipients**: To remove a specific person from an individual email, click the **envelope** icon next to their name.

## Add contacts

The system manages your contact list both automatically and manually.

### Automatic additions

If a request is created from an incoming email, the system automatically adds any addresses in the **To** or **Cc** fields to the **Email contacts** list.

### Manual additions

If you need to add more people to a request, follow these steps:

1. Open the request.
2. Locate the **Email contacts** section.
3. Click **Add** (+).
4. Enter the contact details and save.
