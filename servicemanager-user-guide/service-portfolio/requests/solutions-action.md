# Solutions
The Solutions Action on an incident identifies possible solutions for that particular incident. The solutions icon is dynamic and is only displayed when a potential solution is available.

If an incident is linked to one or more Problem, or Known Error records, and any of those have defined Workarounds, then these will be available as possible Solutions to the Incident.

## Solutions
Solutions consist of information provided by linked known errors and problem records. When workaround information is provided by either of these and they are linked to this particular request, one or more Solutions can be listed, and each is available for review.

* **Accepting a solution**<br>Using the drop-down, a Solution can be marked as accepted. In doing so the Solution will be highlighted in green and that solution will show as an Accepted Solution.
The Solution text is copied into the Resolution text box and is ready for the Incident Owner to resole the Incident.
* **Not the solution**<br>If a Solution or Solutions are not the resolution for the Incident, these can be marked as such and will show as Not the Solution.
* **Resolve using a solution**<br>The Solution text is copied into the Resolution text box and is ready for the Incident Owner to resole the incident if a Solution is accepted.

## FAQs
If an FAQ has been published against the same Service as the request is associated to and that FAQ has the visibility set to Service Desk, these FAQs will be visible on the Solution Action under the FAQ tab.
