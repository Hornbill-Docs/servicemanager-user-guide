# Solutions
The Solutions Action on an incident identifies possible solutions for that particular incident. The solutions icon is dynamic and is only displayed when a potential solution is available.

If an incident is linked to one or more Problem, or Known Error records, and any of those have defined Workarounds, then these will be available as possible Solutions to the Incident.

:::info
The solutions action can be enabled within the [Request Configuration](/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/request-configuration#request-actions) for each service.
