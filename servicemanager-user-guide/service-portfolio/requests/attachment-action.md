# Attachment Action
One or multiple attachments can be added to a request through either dragging and dropping the files into the file box, or using the Select Files option to browse to find and then select the files you wish to attach.

### Comments and Descriptions
Once your files have been added to the attach action, you can provide an optional comment which will be visible on the timeline of the request, which can be used to help explain why the attachments have been added. You also have the option to add a short description to each of the files you are adding which may help describe each file.

### Visibility and Uploading
Once you selected your files and added any supporting comments and descriptions, you can choose the visibility level of the attachments. If this is left as the default Customer, this will allow the customer to view the attachments on the request via their customer or employee portal. If the setting is changed to say team, or owner then the customer will not see these attachments when viewing the request.

### System Settings
Restrictions can be applied to both the type of files which you want to allow to be uploaded and the maximum size of any individual attachments which are being added. These can be managed by your administrator through configuration.
|Name|Description|Default Setting
|-|-|-|
|communications.maxfileUploadSize|Sets the maximum size (in bytes) of a file upload|1000000
|security.fileUploadRestriction.webdav.types|This is a semicolon(;) separated list of the restricted file extensions (without the dots(.)) for file upload|exe;bat;cmd;js;vbs|
