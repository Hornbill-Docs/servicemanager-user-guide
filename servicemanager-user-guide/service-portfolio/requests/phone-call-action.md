# Phone Call Action
Capture information taken from a phone call with a customer. If there is no answer, schedule a callback.

### Customer Information
By default when you view the Phone Call Action it will show the name of the customer associated with the request and their phone number. This provides you with quick access to phone them without having to look up their details.
* Use the `Search` option to look up other user's contact details.
* Initiate a phone call using a linked app by clicking on the customer's phone number.

### Conversation Notes
Use this to capture information about the phone call. These are added to the timeline under the category of **Phone** and will reference the call as being incoming or outgoing depending on the option chosen.

### Schedule a Callback
Built into this action item is a callback feature that lets you schedule an activity to phone the customer back at another time. This callback is added to the activities section of the request and onto your personal Activities View.
