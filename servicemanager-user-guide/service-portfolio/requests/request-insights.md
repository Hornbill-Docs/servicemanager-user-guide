# Request Insights
Request Insights provides key stats and data for an individual request that has been resolved or closed.  A series of charts highlight changes in status, assignment, and the assessment of the request through its life cycle.
 
## Status
The status insights show how long the request had remained in each status.  Only the statuses that were used will be displayed.

* New
* Open
* On-hold
* Resolved

:::note
The closed status is excluded from these charts.

### Sub-statues
If the request being viewed includes sub-statuses, an additional chart is displayed that shows the amount of time that was spent in each sub-status.

## Assignment
The assignment insights summarize the amount of time that the request was with a team or with an owner.  The amount of time between assignments is captured and this insight allows you to see where the request spends most of its time.

* Team
* Owner

## Assessment
The assessment insights summarize the amount of time that the request stayed in each priority level. This can help identify how long it took until a request was reassessed or escalated to a higher priority level.  

* Priority
 
## Exporting
For all three insight views, you can export the information in a variety of image or data formats. This is particularly useful if you need to prepare a report on a request, so you get easy access to include relevant information. 

:::note
Exported data that includes time values will typically be exported as minutes.

## Data Lists
Each chart has an option to show a data list that includes timestamps of when the change took place, and who made the changes.
