# Workaround Action
The Workaround Action Item allows you to record the steps that can be followed to return to a business as normal status. Workarounds can also be published alongside known issues and presented as possible solutions to linked Incidents.

## Defining the Workaround
Use the text box to enter the workaround text, and the save button to create the workaround. There are a couple of considerations to factor in when defining the content of the workaround with the potentially different audiences in mind.

* **Solution**<br>On creating the workaround text, any linked Incidents, or any incidents which are linked in the future, will be presented with the workaround text as a possible solution to their incident.
* **Publish**<br>The workaround text can optionally be included and visible to customers on the self service portals, if the Problem / Known Error is published, and the Include Workaround option is selected.

## Making the Workaround Available as a Possible Solution for related Incidents
As described above once the workaround text is saved, this will immediately be available for the Incident owners, of linked Incidents to review and accept or reject as a solution to the Incident they own.
