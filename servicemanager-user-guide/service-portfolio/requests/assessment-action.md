# Assessment Action
The Assessment Action on a request is all about determining the importance of a request.  One or more criteria including priority, impact, and urgency can be used when making an assessment.

## Priority
Priority is the default option and is available to all requests that use the assessment action. A drop-down list of [priority levels](/servicemanager-config/administration/assessment-levels#default-levels) are available for selection. Once a priority has been selected and applied to the request, it will be displayed in the information panel.

### Benefits of Using Priority
Setting the priority of a request is all about having a focus on the most important requests. There are several visual tools and automations to help achieve this. 
* Visibility in the request list by displaying color-coded priority levels.
* Sorting the request list by priority puts the most important requests at the top.
* Determine the service level targets that will be used for the request.
* Drive workflow automation based on the selected priority.
* Contribute to statistics and reports based on the priority levels.

## Impact
Impact is a way to determine the effect the request may have on your business.  Impact could be based on the number of users that might be affected by the issue or it may have a significant financial impact.

Rather than a simple drop-down list to select from, a questionnaire is presented that can consist of one or more questions that help determine the impact. Each answer provided will have a score against it to automatically apply an Impact Level based on the responses to the questions.

## Urgency
Urgency refers to the importance of how quickly the request needs to be resolved or closed. An incident may not be causing too much at the time it was raised, however, if it isn't resolved within a short timeframe it may cause further problems.

Urgency is not available on the requestâ€™s assessment action by default. There are two options for configuring the use of urgency.

* [Urgency level drop-down list](/servicemanager-config/administration/assessment-levels#urgency)
* [Urgency questionnarire](/servicemanager-config/administration/assessment-questionnaires)

## Request Timeline
Each time an assessment is added or changed on a request, a record is added to the timeline.
