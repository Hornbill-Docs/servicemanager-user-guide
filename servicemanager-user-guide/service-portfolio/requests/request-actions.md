* The actions available on a request can be configured within the service they are associated with.
* The supporting workflow that sits behind the request can control the focus of an action when that action is required to be completed.
* Use the [Access Control automation](/servicemanager-config/customize/workflows/service-manager-workflows#access-control) to lock or unlock individual actions at any point within a workflow.
* [Request Settings](/servicemanager-config/administration/request-settings#on-hold-settings) control which of these options are enabled when an incident is on hold.
