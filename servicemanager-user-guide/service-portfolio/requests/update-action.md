# Update Action
The update action is used for posting information into the timeline which can be used for collaborating with your team members.

### Links and Embedded Content
The update supports text, images, and embedded multimedia/hyperlinks. Simply cut and paste the content, or link you wish to share in the update box. Examples include:
* Sharing a youtube video, which can be viewed in the update from the timeline of the request.
* Links (URL) to another request, workspace post, or document in Hornbill.

### Wiki Mark-Up
For easy formatting of content, a sub-set of Wiki Markup can be used for decorating text, with italics and bold, creating bulleted or numbered lists etc. Use Ctrl+I or Ctrl+B keyboard shortcuts to enable/disable italic and bold text as you type.

### Mentions
It is possible to @mention a co-worker in an update. The mentioned co-worker will receive a Hornbill notification that includes a link to the request.
