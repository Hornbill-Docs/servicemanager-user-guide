# Email Contacts
Email Contacts contains a list of recipients that are associated with a Service Manager request. They are designed to improve speed and consistency when sending emails from a request by ensuring that relevant recipients are automatically included in communications.

### Access
The Email Contacts are available to any user who has permission to open and work on a request.

### Adding recipients to the Email Contacts
Email recipients can be added to the Email Contacts in the following ways:
1. **When a request is automatically raised from an email**. If [Inbound Routing Rules](/esp-config/email/using-email-routing-rules) are configured to raise a request from an incoming email, any additional recipients included in the To or Cc fields (excluding the shared mailbox address) will be added to the Email Contacts.
2. **When a reqeust is manually raised from an email**. When a user manually raises a request from an email stored in a [mailbox](/esp-user-guide/email-overview), any additional recipients included in the To or Cc fields will be added as Email Contacts.
3. **Manually adding Email Contacts**. From an existing request, users can add recipients to the Email Contacts using the plus `+` icon.
