# Customer
The Customer Action allows a user to assign a customer to a request, or change who the customer of the request is.

In many scenarios the customer will have been initially populated when the request was raised through intelligent capture.

## Changing Customer
Using the search subscriber option, you can select to search both the co-workers and contacts to find the customer to change too. The default position is to search both. Once a customer has been found, you can update the customer of the request using the Change Customer button.

## Visibility
Decide if the customer action post on the timeline of the request will be customer facing or private to the team working on the request.
