# Linked Requests Action
The Link Action within a request enables two main functions. Firstly, the searching for and linking of existing requests, and secondly the raising of new linked requests.

### Linking Requests
Use the Search bar to find related requests and link them to the request.
* **Filters**<br>Use the supplied filters to narrow the returned results, options include Status, Type, Customer, Owner, Service
* **Link**<br>From the Returned Results, use the Link button next to each request, to link it to the request
    * *Relationships*<br>If Service Manager Relationship Links have been configured, choose from one of the available Link types, to create not only a link but a defined relationship between the requests. If Relationship Links have not been configured, no drop-down will appear, and requests will use the generic Link option.

### Raising Linked Requests
As well as linking the request to other existing requests, you can use the Raise New Linked Request option to create a new request, which will automatically be linked to the request.
* The request types available will depend on your rights to raise the different request types.
* Choosing the Request Type for the Linked Request, will initiate the Intelligent Capture for that request type
    * The summary and description from the original request will be populated into the Request Details Intelligent Capture form fields, if selected in the capture flow.

### Linked Requests
As soon as the request is either linked to other existing requests or a new request is created from the request, a new collapsable section will appear on the request view.
* Linked requests will be displayed.
* Options to unlink or edit the relationship link (If Relationship Links have been configured and used) will be presented.
