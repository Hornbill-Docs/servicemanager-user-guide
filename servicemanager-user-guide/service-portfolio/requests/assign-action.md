# Assign
The Assign Action allows a request to be to a team or individual.

## Available Teams
When viewing the teams to which you can assign the request too, the drop-down will only display the teams that support the Service which the request has been logged. Read more about Supporting teams here.

## Analysts Presence and Availability
When deciding which analyst to assign the request to, you can view both the analyst's presence and their availability.

### Presence
These settings indicate if the analyst is online, online via the mobile app or offline. The following describes each of the visual prompts.

* **Online** (Green Circle)<br>The analyst is logged into the user app and has been active for the last 15 minutes.
* **Inactive** (Golden Circle)<br>The analyst is logged in but has not been active in the last 15 minutes
* **Offline** (Hollow Circle)<br>The analyst is not logged into the user or mobile app.
* **Mobile Image**<br>The analyst is logged into the mobile app.

### Availability
The analysts can set their status from their profile and account settings, an availability setting is always required and can be set as Available or other options including, In A Meeting, Do Not Disturb, or On Holiday as examples.

If the analyst's availability is set to anything other than Available the current availability status will be displayed against the analyst in the drop-down list.
If a supporting message has been provided by the analyst to support their availability status, this can be viewed by hovering over the analyst's name in the list.

## Visibility
Decide if the assign action post on the timeline of the request will be customer facing or private to the team working on the request.

## Take Ownership
On the request's Information box, a button is made available that allows a user to quickly Take Ownership of the request without using the Assign action. This button is only visible when

* The user is a member of the currently assigned team.
* The request is not currently assigned to an owner.
