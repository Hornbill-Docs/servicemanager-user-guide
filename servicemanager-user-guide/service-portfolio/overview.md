# Overview
The Service Portfolio provides features and configuration settings for defining the Services that you offer to your customers. These options include services, request priorities, and Corporate Service Level Agreements.

Each defined service can include a combination of service levels, business process workflows, request routing, and subscriptions. The number of defined services may range from a single service used to define and manage all IT requests, to a collection of categorized services, with each one providing a particular focus.

## Services
The Services List provides a list of the services that are being managed within Service Manager.

## Corporate Service Level Agreements
The Corporate Service Level Agreements (SLA) tab allows you to define your corporate service level agreements which can be shared between services. Each Corporate SLA lets you define Service Levels, Service Level Targets and the rules for applying these to requests.
