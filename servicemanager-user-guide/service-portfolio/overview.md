# Overview
The Service Portfolio provides features and configuration for defining business services offered to employees and customers and technical services that underpin these business services.

The portfolio consists of services in various stages, ranging from pipeline to retirement. These services can be defined, planned, delivered, and reviewed to ensure continual improvement.

## Before you begin
* Users must have the [Services Manager Role](/servicemanager-config/setup/service-manager-roles#services) to access the Service Portfolio and to create and manage services.

## Service visibility
When viewing the service portfolio, the services displayed in the list are limited by ownership and by the membership of the [teams that support the service](/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/services/service-details#supporting-teams).

* **Service owner**. The [service owner](/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/services/service-details#owner) can see all the services they own.
* **A service without dedicated support teams**. A user with the *[Services Manager](/servicemanager-config/setup/service-manager-roles#services)* role can see any service that doesn't have dedicated [support teams](/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/services/service-details#supporting-teams). 
* **A service with one or more dedicated support teams**. A user with the *[Services Manager](/servicemanager-config/setup/service-manager-roles#services)* role can only see the services where they are a member of one of the dedicated [support teams](/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/services/service-details#supporting-teams) for that service.

## Service Catalog
The Service Catalog contains services that are active and available for employees and customers to consume.  These services can be accessed through the Customer and Employee portals.

## Services
The goal of a service is to deliver value to customers and employees through a variety of mechanisms:

* Communications between the service desk and the customers.
* Incident reporting and management.
* Request fulfillment.
* Service availability.
* Continual service improvements.
* Service level agreements (SLAs).
* Self-service access through portals.

## Request Catalog
Each individual service allows a services manager to build a request catalog.  A request catalog contains one or more models that define the information to capture and the workflows to process the different types of requests.

Models include the following:
* Request type
* Intelligent Capture
* Workflow
* Available actions
* Visibility
