# Frequently Ask Questions (FAQ)
FAQs or Frequently Asked Questions are a great way to provide some knowledge about questions that are commonly asked for. Unique sets of FAQs can be provided for each Service and made accessible to both Customers and Support Staff. For customers, FAQs can be published on the Self Service Portals to present self-help information. For support staff, they can create more technically focused FAQs that are only visible to them and used as an aide to resolve incidents faster.
