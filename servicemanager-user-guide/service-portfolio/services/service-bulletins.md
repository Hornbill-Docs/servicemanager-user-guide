## Create a bulletin

You can create and manage bulletins directly from the [service records](/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/services/service-details) in your service portfolio. Follow these steps to add a new bulletin.

### Before you begin

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to manage service records in the [Service Portfolio](/servicemanager-user-guide/service-portfolio/overview).

### Steps

1. Open the service record where you want to add a bulletin.
2. Select the **Bulletin** tab.
3. Click **+Add Bulletin Item**.
4. Fill in the bulletin details and configuration options.
5. Click **Save** to create the bulletin.

### Expected result

The new bulletin appears in the list on the **Bulletin** tab. If you set the status to **Published**, it will be visible to subscribers on their portals.

## Bulletin configuration settings

When you create or edit a bulletin, you can customize the following fields and options.

When you create or edit a bulletin, you can customize the following fields and options.

### Content settings

* **Title**: Enter a heading for the bulletin.
* **Description**: Provide a summary of the announcement. You can use the text editor to format text or add hyperlinks. The description has a limit of 400 characters.
* **Background Image**: Upload an image to act as the bulletin background. For the best results, use an image that is 1000px by 300px.
* **Employee Portal Link**: Add a URL to make the entire bulletin a clickable link within the Employee Portal.
* **Languages**: Create versions of the bulletin in multiple languages. The portal displays the version that matches the language in the user's regional settings. English is the default.

### Display options

The following options only apply to the Customer Portal.

* **Show Title and Description**: Turn this on to show the title and description. Turn this off if your background image already contains the message text.
* **Text Shadow**: Turn this on to add a shadow to the text in the title and description. This helps the text stand out against certain background images. This option is only available when the **Show Title and Description** is turned on.

### Visibility and status

* **Start Date**: Choose a date and time for the bulletin to become visible. If you leave this blank, the bulletin appears as soon as you publish it.
* **End Date**: Choose a date and time for the bulletin to disappear. If you leave this blank, the bulletin stays visible until you manually retire it.
* **Status**: Select one of three states:
  * **Draft**: The bulletin is saved but not visible on portals.
  * **Published**: The bulletin is visible to subscribers on portals.
  * **Retired**: The bulletin is no longer visible on portals.

## View bulletins

Subscribers can view published bulletins in the following locations on the Customer and Service Portals:

* **My Services view**: If a user has multiple bulletins across different services, they appear in a carousel at the top of the page.
* **Service-specific view**: Bulletins related to a specific service appear on that service's page.

### Carousel behavior

* Bulletins automatically transition every five seconds.
* Users can pause the carousel or manually move between bulletins using the arrow controls.

* Hyperlinks in the bulletin text open in a new browser tab.

* **Reorder bulletins**: Drag and drop items in the list to change the order they appear in the portal carousel.
* **Edit or change status**: Click the **Cog** icon next to a bulletin to update its details or change its visibility state.
* **Delete a bulletin**: Click the **Trash Can** icon to permanently remove a bulletin.
