# Service Documents
Documents that are held within Document Manager can be associated to a Service. This is designed to provide document access to the subscribers of the service through the Customer and Employee Portals.

> It is important to ensure that the documents linked to the service are held within a library that has been configured for access on the portals. Linking a document that is held in a library that is not configured for portal access will result in the document being listed, but not accessible by the service subscriber.


## Sharing a Library with the Portals
The option for sharing libraries is managed from within the Document Manager app.

1. From the main Hornbill Tile Menu, select Document Manager -> Libraries.
1. From the list of libraries, find the library that you would like to make available to the portals and select Properties.
1. On the Share option start by selecting Role and then search for the Docmanager Portal.
1. Select Can View Library Contents and then click Share.
1. Repeat for each library that you would like make accessible on the portals

## Library Visibility Options
On the Library properties, visibility can be controlled so that a library is only visible to customers when viewing the Service details. By default, a library is visible within the Portals' Library List. In order remove the library from the library list and only have it show associated documents on the Service form, the two following options in Document Manager Libraries need to be un-checked.
* **Show in User Library List**<br>Untick to hide the library in the employee portal and collaboration, this will only take effect if the user has been shared the library with read-only access (users with modify permissions will still be able to see this library). You will still be able to share documents in this library with users with read only permissions by giving them a direct link to the document
* **Show in Customer Portal Library List**<br>Untick to hide the library in the customer portal, (the library must be shared with a guest role before it can be accessed in the customer portal). You will still be able to share documents in this library with customers even if this setting is unticked by giving them a direct link to the document.

## Adding a Document to a Service
On each Service form within the Service Portfolio, a Documents option lets you browse the list of all documents that belong to a particular library and link or unlink documents to the service. This action only be performed by the Service's owner.
* **Select Library**<br>Select from the list of available libraries that you want to browse
* **Order By**<br>To help locate a document, you can change the order of the list by
    * Title
    * Owner
    * File Type
    * Creation Date
    * Updated Date

Each document will have a Link option. When clicked, this will associate the document with the service. Documents already linked to a service ill have an option to Un-link. When clicked, this will remove the document from the service.
