# Overview
Service Level Agreements allow you to define a combination of Service Levels and Service Level Targets which can be used across multiple services that share the same service level requirements. Where a Service Desk offers a standard set of Service Levels across all of its services, using Corporate Service Level Agreements can centralize the management of these Service Levels into one place rather than on a service by service basis.

## Details
The following SLA Details are required when first creating a new SLA and are available within the SLA form.

* **Name**<br>The name of the Service Level Agreement will be used to fine and link to Services and will be visible on the requests that they are associated to. As an unlimited number of SLAs can be created so it is important to provide a name that is descriptive enough to reflect its use.
* **Description**<br>Define the purpose of the SLA and what it covers. This description may be used to help in the selection of a the SLA.
* **Working Time Calendar**<br>This is the defined work hours for the Service Desk that that is responsible for fulfilling the Service Level Agreement. A Working Time Calendar includes the timezone, days of the week, hours within each day, and exclusion days such as holidays. The calculation of Service Level Targets will be based on the selected Working Time Calendar.
